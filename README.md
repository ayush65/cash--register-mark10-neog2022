# CASH REGISTER

This project is been made to so that check the number of change we get after paying the bill amount . 

First we have to give the bill amount and the bill amount should not be zero (0) then the bill amount will be invalid .

Even the cash given should be greater than the bill amount . 

if we give a valid bill amount and the cash given then the it will return the change in terms of notes . 


This project is made for  Mark 10 NEOG CAMP .
